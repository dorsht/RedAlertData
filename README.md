# RedAlertData

I wrote this python script in order to receive data about the red alerts in Israel during operation Guardian of the Walls from Pikud Ha'Oref API and show them on graphs.
The shown data is for the last 7 days.

You have the ability to see the following data:

1. The 40 most alerted areas.
2. Number of alerts per hour for all the areas.
3. Number of alerts per hour for specific area, by user selection.

Prerequisites: pandas, matplotlib, bidi.
